indicating that at least part of the explanation for the apparent rise is probably better diagnostics asperger s and kanner s syndrome asperger described his patients as little professors in the current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv tr the most significant difference between autistic disorder kanner s and asperger s syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas with onset prior to age three years one social interaction two language as used in social communication or three symbolic or imaginative play while a diagnosis of asperger s syndrome observes no clinically significant delay in these areas the dsm makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning but the fact that asperger s autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with kanner s autism has produced a popular conception that asperger s syndrome is synonymous with higher functioning autism or that it is a lesser disorder than autism there is also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have asperger s autism or that both types are merely geeks with a medical label attached also autism has evolved in the public understanding but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately depicted in rain man has encouraged relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as having asperger s syndrome rather than autism autism as a spectrum disorder another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as autistic spectrum disorders a related continuum is sensory integration dysfunction which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our senses autism asperger s syndrome and sensory integration dysfunction are all closely related and overlap there are two main manifestations of classical autism regressive autism and early infantile autism early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of three and often around one eight months although this causes some controversy over when the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin some believe that it is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the disorder this triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin that enters the mother s body and is transfered to the fetus the triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the child s body increase in diagnoses of autism the number of reported cases of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade statistics in graph from the national center for health statistics there has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years which is largely reminiscent of increases in the diagnosis of schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder in the twentieth century this has brought rise to a number
